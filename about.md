*Misanthropolis* is a zero-player browser game designed to simulate a small human civilization. The simulated people of *Misanthropolis* must endure without interference from the player. Grounded in hard determinism, in *Misanthropolis*, the same starting conditions produce the same results.

## Mechanics
*Misanthropolis* runs locally on your browser using JavaScript. This website essentially just hosts the code and base assets. Your computer handles the rest (i.e. processing, rendering, memory, and data storage).

### Geometry
The game uses a 2D square grid, with each square equal to 10 m<sup>2</sup>.
